### License checker

Lots of organisations use third party dependencies without having a clear idea of the open soure licenses used. 

License checker (duh) gives you information about the third party dependencies in your package.json file and lets you generate an attribution file to include in your repository to comply with those licenses which require attribution.

See some samples:
